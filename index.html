        <div class="text-gray-800 justified-text" style="max-width: 480px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <p>Dear visitor,</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Semester Zero is a five-week pop-up college organized by Convocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 24px;">By the end of this year, Convocation will close on <a href="https://www.cbre.com/properties/properties-for-lease/specialty/details/US-SMPL-165149/wells-college-170-main-street-aurora-ny-13026" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">this</a> campus to begin building a college from first-principles. You can think of Semester Zero as our MVP. 
</p>

            <p>It’ll be hosted through July 13th to August 17th at the Archbishop’s Mansion in Alamo Square, San Francisco. Our aspiration is for the experience to combine the best of collegiate rigor, hacker house culture, and monastic discipline.</p>
            
            <p>In the morning, you’ll meditate and exercise with a trainer. In the afternoon, you’ll study and work on your personal project. In the evening, you’ll participate in seminars taught by college professors. For example, Ari Gabinet from Brown University will teach a course on law and public policy, truncating a semester’s worth of material into one week.</p>

            <p>The program fee is a 2.5% FUTURE (“free university through upfront rights to equity”).The FUTURE means that Convocation is entitled to 2.5% of any company you become a founder/co-founder of within five years of Semester Zero.</p> 
            
            </p>You don’t need to have a plan to start a company, or have one incorporated yet. The FUTURE only activates if you decide to become a founder. If you do, we’ll cover incorporation costs and other backend services through our partnership with Every.io.</p> 

            <p>The FUTURE is essentially a quantifiable form of artistic patronage. We don’t believe in free money (yeah…I know it contradicts what the f in FUTURE stands for). If something is free, you’re probably the product. Frankly, I find it disappointing how many programs fail to treat their college-aged participants like adults.</p>
            
            <p>We won’t parade you around on social media like a Disney channel star. We won’t slap your name on our website. We won’t beg you for testimonials and retweets. We’re running this pop-up like a secret Manhattan project, and you should be in control of your own narrative.</p>

            <p>The FUTURE fee creates a sense of mutual responsibility and respect between artist and patron (or investor and founder). We want to help you win in whatever domain you’re in, and not just in a high-level meta way. Helping you win means playing unfair games. Unlike existing universities, we’re not afraid to play unfair games to help our students.</p>
        
            <p>Because they are pioneering a new concept, our first 10 students are receiving a stipend of $1-10k (student #1, $10k, second #2,  $9k, etc.). The remaining 40 students won’t receive a stipend, but they’ll be eligible for all the perks offered by the Semester Zero.</p>
           
            <p>You can apply here in <60 seconds. If you have any questions about the program, please text <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanadell/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Ryan Adell</a> at (631)-948-1239. </p>
